This bottleneck limited how many proposals each designer could generate, directly impacting revenue and project timelines. Sales teams couldn't scale. Onboarding new designers took weeks. Most neighborhoods got ignored because teams only had capacity to quote \"sure bet\" homes.",

Designed experiment-driven approach: prioritized 3 edge cases (complex geometries, shadows, low-quality imagery). Result: Cut dataset to 15k high-quality images while dramatically improving model performance.",
      "execution": "Coordinated ML engineer (Ankit Gupta) and engineering lead across 9-month timeline. Navigated technical limitations through iterative experimentation vs. brute-force data collection. Shipped to production on time despite pivoting from quantity (60k) to quality (15k) approach.",
      "gtm": "Drove adoption with 6 new customer organizations within first 6 months. Enabled new sales motion: 'Canvas entire neighborhoods, not just cherry-picked homes.' Reduced new designer onboarding from weeks to days."
